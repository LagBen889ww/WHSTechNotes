I cant say I like the new cell phone law or hate it.
The new cell phone law will help some of us with distractions, attention span and actually work. This benifits us and teachers but it also can make it harder on all of us because some students might not want to listen to the law. Students wont listen and some might start arguing, fighting, having an attitude and sleeping more in class. Teachers see this as a good thing but they only think inside the box (Not all teachers) assuming that the kids will listen to the law. The state probally thought that making it a law was gonna automatically make students get off their phones.
This futher proves that I dont hate or like it. I personally dont care if im not allowed on my phone because i wasn't on it a lot anyways my only problem is that we cant listen to music in class anymore.

I career I would wanna do in the futur is art, digital media disigner, or selling things I make.
Computer science can be valuable in many ways like I could use it for building a website for art or selling things in general.
If I would want to sell things on a personel website for my itmes specificlly Im going to need to make it.
Art wise for computer science can help with like managment of varius items like money, inventory, stocks, and updates.
With all the things I can do with knowing computer science can really help me with futur things that I want to do.

I think AI sould be used to help people in education, health, safety, or the community.
AI has been being used for a lot of bad things are dumb things.
People use AI for cheating on stuff, using it for dumb reasons, and just making content that doesn't need to be made.
AI can be really useful for education for like, explaining things, grading work, making assignments, other things for electives but AI has been used for cheating so much that all schools ban using AI.
The reason I listed that could be useful from AI are all good things to come out of AI.

In my opinion working in a virtual store could probally one of the worst ideas ive ever heard.
Working virtually losses so many things you need to learn in an actual work inviroment like social/people skills, communication improvment, and simply just need that experience.
Also when you want to get a real job in person and you have a resume and it lists that you worked at roblox ikea, virtual they might not think thats a proper skill.
I also think that working in an actual work in enviroment is needed no matter the circumstance because you need to have that skill.
If they start making more virtual jobs then most people are gonna wanna do that then a actual real job that needs people to be in like hospitals, fire fighters, police, mechanics, and many more because their all needed in the world
With this all being said I think virtual work places shoukd not be a thing especially for real money.

When students say the phrase "67" their usally refers to a popular meme of a kid saying 67. During a basketball game a camera panned to the kid and said 67. Kids say in the hallway just to be funny but then some kids dont the its funny. Kids say it in a funny and unserious tone. I still like 67 but its been way to long.

If i was in charge of a school I would definitly allow games in school, I would make it to where the last 15-20 minutes games are allowed. I think games shouldnt be a banned thing in school and im not just saying that because there nblocked now. I also think AI should very for what assignments its used on, I dont think AI should be used on major projocts or assignments. If you use AI on major things that should be a definate write up. I dont think any of these things should be banned/blocked same thing as phones, I dont see a reaosn for any of this to be gone.

My prompt was designed to list some popular AI sites to write prompts on and to explain how to write a prompt correctly. I also wrote to make it understandable so highschoolers can read it and understand it. This way it would be a lot easier to make and write AI prompts. I made it list AI websites so that people can find a easy way to find the website and not look for a random site that isnt reliable. I also had to list a very specific request to not make it an "inventation flyer" because the first time it made it into a inventation type flyer.

Technology can help before the disater helping people know where to go or help other people get in contect others. I don't know if technology would help during the hurricane due to it currently happening and could knock out the electrical/cell phone poles. Same thing eith after the hurricane I don't know if the poles would be out after all the damage. Some tools can help try to find missing people if any like a heat tracker. If i could invent another invention to help with these hurricans I would make something thhat could collect energy from the hurricane and use it as a power grid source.
I think families are more connected with technology during the holidays.
Techology helps families connect more during the holidays so they can find out whos showing up during the holidays and plan out the day. I think technology makes the holidays better because it is easier to do things with others and good to have when trying to find/plan for the occasion. Yes holiday tech should respect privacy during the holidays and the things you do with families. 
With all this being said, yes I think that technology is goodfor the holidays and makes them better.

One real job that involes drones is being a photographer at like party's, weddings, events, or just in general. People use coding for the drones to make them do a specific action at a certisn time or other things like hieght or zoom. The average salary for a drone pilot in San Antonio, TX, varies by source, but generally falls between $50,000 and $68,000 annually. To be a commercial drone pilot in the U.S., you need a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA, which requires passing the Aeronautical Knowledge Exam. No I would not want to do this job in the future because I think the requirments are to much to fly a drone.

I think it might fail to recognize the stop sign because its in a wierd position unlike normale ones. The camera, sensors, AI might face some legal actions for failing to recognize the sign. I would disign the car to be able to recognize any stop sign and and stop on it. I would make it to read the sign and actullay sensor the stop sign. I would aslo have the AI to sense the bus and anyone on it to where if it sees them it stops

All I plan to do during the break is sleep and grind games all day so my break isn't that full. I also plan to watch the new episodes of stranger things on the holidays. Other then all that I dont have anything planned on the holidays.
